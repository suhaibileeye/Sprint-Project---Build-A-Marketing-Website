                Iqra Islamic School (IIS) was founded in 1996 as a full-time private school serving the Muslim community in the city of London 
                and beyond.  Since its inception, LIS has consistently grown year after year and has gained a reputation of becoming a leading 
                Muslim educational institute which aims to instill an Islamic morale and a genuine desire of learning in each of its students. 
LIS provides an Islamic learning environment with a commitment of using modern day teaching pedagogy to cultivate an advanced and comprehensive 
academic program; fully compliant with the Ontario curriculum of studies.  We are a K to 8 school with a wide array of resources designed to 
foster student achievement that will prepare our pupils to pursue higher education and be competitive in their careers.  It is our aim to empower
 our students by cultivating their interests and honing their academic skills as strong Canadian-Muslim citizens in Canada.</h3>
